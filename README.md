# Clean Architecture Workshop

This workshop requires student to implement a working API they can choose 
between different API's implementation:
- [Pokemon Trainer](docs/pokemon/INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- [Library](docs/library/INSTRUCTIONS.md)

There is an [Insomnia](docs/Insomnia.json) or a 
[Paw](docs/Clean%20Architecture%20Workshop.paw) file for each of the 
projects, and each project has it's own OpenApi specification for each of the 
projects as well.

After implementing all the endpoints, each projects needs to add a caching 
layer to avoid requesting the API multiple times.
